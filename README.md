#Resizable Working Files Pane

Use by selected *View* -> *Resize Working Files*

This will allow you to resize the 'Working Files' pane in [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

If you have *Split View* on, the Working Files pane will split the space evenly between the two views even if one has more files than the other.

**Note:** As of v1.7.0, I have changed the name of the extension in `package.json` to be consistent with naming across the extension. Because of this if you do not uninstall v1.6.0 in the extension manager and install the new version then you will not be getting updates.
