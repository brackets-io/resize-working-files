#Resizable Working Files Pane (WIP)

Use by selected *View* -> *Resize Working Files*

This will allow you to resize the 'Working Files' pane in [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

If you have *Split View* on, the Working Files pane will split the space evenly between the two views even if one has more files than the other.
